/*Given a year, return the century it is in.

The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100,
the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

Let's see some examples:

centuryFromYear(1705) // returns 18
centuryFromYear(1900) // returns 19
centuryFromYear(1601) // returns 17
centuryFromYear(2000) // returns 20
Hope you enjoy it .. Awaiting for Best Practice Codes hahaha ..

Enjoy Learning !!!
